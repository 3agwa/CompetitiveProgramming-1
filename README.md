#Competitive Programming

A collection of algorithms, data structures and other useful information for competitive programming.

##TODO

Here is a list of algorithms and data structures that need to be added.

###Shortest Path
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algorithm (along with negative-weight cycle check)
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm

###Minimum Spanning Tree
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Prim's algorithm

###Maximum Flow
- Edmonds-Karp algorithm
- Dinic's algorithm

###Strongly Connected Components
- Kosaraju's algorithm
- Tarjan's algorithm

###Assignment Problem
- Hungarian algorithm

###Cycle Detection
- Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm

###Number Theory and related
- The Euclidean algorithm
- The Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Modular Multiplicative Inverse
- Euler's Totient (formula)
- Divisor Sum (formula)
- Divisor Count (formula)
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Primality Testing (at least Trial Division, maybe more)

###More Algorithms
- Review the [list of algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) on Wikipedia.
