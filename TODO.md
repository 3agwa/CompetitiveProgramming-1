Things to do
============

* Fix min cost max flow (infinite loop on negative weights, e.g. https://icpc.kattis.com/problems/catering)
* Fix convex hull edge case (some small edge case that included at least three collinear lines would return the same point on both the upper and lower hull)
* Fix 2d-Tree (for some reason it's segfaulting on tests)
* Shortest Path Faster Algorithm
* Prim's algorithm
* More formulas for geometry, trigonometry, —Åombinatorics, number theory
* Edmonds's maximum matching algorithm (Blossom algorithm)
* Hungarian algorithm
* Sweeping line algorithm for finding the pair of intersecting segments in a set of segments
* Simplex method
* Add more Geometry stuff.
* Edmond's optimum branching algorithm
* Add a list of debugging tips
* Add a list of algorithm types to keep in mind when solving a problem
* Add more formulas
* Test Tridiagonal matrix algorithm on http://codeforces.com/contest/24/problem/D
* Use the Node interface of Segment Tree in HLD.


How do we check how much memory is used by an executable?
