Things to do
============

* Fix min cost max flow (infinite loop on negative weights, e.g. https://icpc.kattis.com/problems/catering)
* Fix convex hull edge case (some small edge case that included at least three collinear lines would return the same point on both the upper and lower hull)
* Fix 2d-Tree (for some reason it's segfaulting on tests)
* Shortest Path Faster Algorithm
* Prim's algorithm
* More formulas for geometry, trigonometry, —Åombinatorics, number theory
* Edmonds's maximum matching algorithm (Blossom algorithm)
* Interval Tree
* Hungarian algorithm
* Sweeping line algorithm for finding the pair of intersecting segments in a set of segments
* Simplex method
* Add more Geometry stuff.
* Edmond's optimum branching algorithm
* Add a list of debugging tips:
    - getting a NaN? make sure acos/.. are not getting values out of their range (perhaps 1+eps)
    - stack overflow? recursive tree on dfs that is actually a long path?
* Add a list of algorithm types to keep in mind when solving a problem:
    - dynamic programming
    - greedy
    - randomized
    - optimizations
        - use bitset (/ 64)
        - switch order of loops (cache locality)
    - process queries offline
        - Mo's algorithm
    - square-root decomposition
    - precomputation
    - efficient simulation:
        - Mo's algorithm
        - sqrt decomposition
        - store 2^k jump pointers
    - data structure techniques
        - sqrt buckets
        - store 2^k jump pointers
        - 2^k merging trick
    - counting
        - inclusion-exclusion principle
    - strongly connected components
    - heuristics
        - A*
        - branch and bound
    - graph properties
        - cycles
        - bipartite (no odd cycles)
        - cut vertex/bridge
        - biconnected components
    - mathematics
        - is the function multiplicative?
    - 2sat
    - meet in the middle
    - take the smaller half (log(n))
    - trie (maybe over something weird, like bits)
    - ...
* Add more formulas
    - v - e + f = 2
    - \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k C(n,k) = (-1)^m C(n-1,m)
    - 2^\omega(n) = O(\sqrt{n}), where \omega(n) is the number of distinct prime factors
    - \sum{i=1}^n 2^\omega{i} = O(n \log n)
