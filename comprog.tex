        shortest path to augment each time (instead of just any path). It

\section{Useful Information}
    \subsection{Tips \&{} Tricks}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How fast does our algorithm have to be? Can we use
                brute-force?
            \item Does order matter?
            \item Is it better to look at the problem in another way? Maybe
                backwards?
            \item Are there subproblems that are recomputed? Can we cache them?
            \item Do we need to remember everything we compute, or just the
                last few iterations of computation?
            \item Does it help to sort the data?
            \item Can we speed up lookup by using a map (tree or hash) or an
                array?
            \item Can we binary search the answer?
            \item Can we add vertices/edges to the graph to make the problem
                easier? Can we turn the graph into some other kind of a graph
                (perhaps a DAG, or a flow network)?
            \item Make sure integers are not overflowing.
            \item Is it better to compute the answer modulo $n$? Perhaps we can
                compute the answer modulo $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k$, where
                $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k$ are pairwise coprime integers, and find
                the real answer using CRT?
            \item Are there any edge cases? When $n=0, n=-1, n=1, n=2^{31}-1$
                or $n=-2^{31}$? When the list is empty, or contains a single
                element? When the graph is empty, or contains a single vertex?
                When the graph contains self-loops?  When the polygon is
                concave or non-simple?
            \item Can we use exponentiation by squaring?
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Fast Input Reading}
        If input or output is huge, sometimes it is beneficial to optimize the
        input reading/output writing. This can be achieved by reading all input
        in at once (using fread), and then parsing it manually. Output can also
        be stored in an output buffer and then dumped once in the end (using
        fwrite). A simpler, but still effective, way to achieve speed is to use
        the following input reading method.
        \code{tricks/fast_input.cpp}

    \subsection{128-bit Integer}
        GCC has a 128-bit integer data type named \texttt{\_\_int128}. Useful
        if doing multiplication of 64-bit integers, or something needing a
        little more than 64-bits to represent.

    \subsection{Worst Time Complexity}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
            $n$ & Worst AC Algorithm & Comment \\
            \hline
            $\leq 10$ & $O(n!), O(n^6)$ & e.g. Enumerating a permutation \\
            $\leq 15$ & $O(2^n\times n^2)$ & e.g. DP TSP \\
            $\leq 20$ & $O(2^n), O(n^5)$ & e.g. DP + bitmask technique \\
            $\leq 50$ & $O(n^4)$ & e.g. DP with 3 dimensions + $O(n)$ loop, choosing  $_nC_k=4$ \\
            $\leq 10^2$ & $O(n^3)$ & e.g. Floyd Warshall's \\
            $\leq 10^3$ & $O(n^2)$ & e.g. Bubble/Selection/Insertion sort \\
            $\leq 10^5$ & $O(n\log_2{n})$ & e.g. Merge sort, building a Segment tree \\
            $\leq 10^6$ & $O(n), O(\log_2{n}), O(1)$ & Usually, contest problems have $n\leq10^6$ (e.g. to read input) \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Bit Hacks}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{n \&{} -n} returns the first set bit in $n$.
            \item \texttt{n \&{} (n - 1)} is $0$ only if $n$ is a power of two.
            \item \texttt{snoob(x)} returns the next integer that has the
                same amount of bits set as \texttt{x}. Useful for iterating
                through subsets of some specified size.
